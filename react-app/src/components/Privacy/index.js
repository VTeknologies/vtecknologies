            Our Services allow you to create connections or integrations between
            the third-party applications you use. When you utilize the Services,
            information or content is transferred from one application to
            another, and we collect this transferred information. Other users
            may provide information about individuals when they submit content
            or information through the Services. For example, if a user sets up
            an automated calendaring process, they will share information about
            the individuals they schedule meetings with through the integration.
            Users may also provide information about their teammates, such as
            names and email addresses, to invite them to use the Services.
            Additionally, an administrator might provide your contact
            information if they designate you as a user, billing contact,
            technical contact, or administrator. You or your administrator may
            integrate the Services with third-party applications.
            <br />
            <br /> In such cases, we receive information that identifies your
            account within those third-party applications, including your name,
            email address, phone number, tokens, and other identifying
            information, along with log data, content, and device information.
            The information or content we receive from your organization is
            subject to your organization’s privacy policies. The information we
            receive when you integrate our Services with a third-party
            application depends on the settings, permissions, and privacy
            policies of that third-party application. Authentication information
            used to identify an account will not be saved, or if saved, it will
            be stored within the application and not in any other private
            storage.
